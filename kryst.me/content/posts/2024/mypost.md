## My first post?
Firstly, Yesterday at [2.07], I participated in new BJJ classes; it was my third attempt to become a new prof. It seems to be ok; I've learned the single-leg approach, squeezing with the leg, and knee-stand-up. First, when I fall into half-guard, I need to bend a knee under my ass, then push my body into this leg and stand via knee. The last part is to take over the leg and try to push guard. Easy. 

QA: ISTQB is incoming, I need to fully involve myself into 20 pages of the day plus 5 pages of short notes. 

Dev. This was my current goal. I achieved it; let's see, I need a grocery list.
